#basic demo of "for" loops
# will loop through based on the defined "range" or 10 times
for number in range(10):
    print("Hello")
    print("Hi There")
    print(number)


fav_movies = ['Dirty Dancing', 'Grease', 'Pretty Woman']

for movie in fav_movies:
    print(movie)

for demo_num in range(1000):
    print(demo_num)

#challenge: 
#loop 40 times, each print the number the loop x 2

for multiplier in range(40):
    print((multiplier + 1) * 2)
